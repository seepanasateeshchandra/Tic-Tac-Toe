# Tic-Tac-Toe
A classic two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game played entirely in the terminal. This project serves as an excellent introduction to Java programming, covering fundamental concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, and user input handling.


**Objective**
The goal is to create a simple yet functional Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows two players to alternate turns, placing their respective markers ('X' or 'O') on a 3x3 grid, with the game determining the outcomeâ€”win, lose, or draw.

**#Features**
1.Two-Player Mode: Supports two human players taking turns.
2.Input Validation: Ensures players enter valid moves within the grid and on unoccupied cells.
3.Game Status Display: Continuously updates and displays the game board after each move.
4.Win/Draw Detection: Automatically detects and announces a win or draw condition.

# Installation & Setup

git clone https://github.com/sateesh chandra/tic-tac-toe
cd tic-tac-toe

**#Run the Game:**
java tic_tac_toe.java

**#Sample GamePlay**
